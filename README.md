1. Download the zip file from the latest [release](https://github.com/stkenny/Refine-NER-Extension/releases/download/v1.6.2/ner-1.6.2.zip)
1. If it does not exist, create a folder named **extensions/ner** under your user workspace directory for OpenRefine. The workspace should be located in the following places depending on your operating system (see [OpenRefine FAQ](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ-Where-Is-Data-Stored) for more details):
    * Linux ~/.local/share/OpenRefine
    * Windows C:/Documents and Settings/<user>/Application Data/OpenRefine OR C:/Documents and Settings/<user>/Local Settings/Application Data/OpenRefine
    * Mac OSX ~/Library/Application Support/OpenRefine
2. Unzip the downloaded release into the extensions/ner folder (step 1).
3. Restart OpenRefine (OpenRefine usage instructions are provided in the [user documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions#release-version))
4. Open or create a project
5. Click the *Named-entity recognition* button at the top right, choose *Configure services...*.

## Usage
1. Click the small triangle before the column name and choose *Extract named entities...*
2. Select the services you want to use.
3. Click *Start extraction*.

### Services

#### StanfordNLP
In order to use StanfordNLP an instance of the service must be running.

0. Download the [NLP service software](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html) 
0. Extract the download, and from within the extracted directory run
   ```java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000```

#### NIF services

This option lets you connect to any annotation service which supports the [NIF protocol](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/wiki/How-to-create-a-NIF-based-web-service). You can find a list of services in [the configuration file of the GERBIL platform](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/blob/master/src/main/properties/annotators.properties) (not
all services listed there are NIF-compliant, you need to look for those with `NIFBasedAnnotatorWebservice` as a class).
